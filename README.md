# SRT Bootcamp Materials (July 6th - 10th)

This project holds materials for the Stone Ridge Technology HPC Bootcamp,
to be held July 6th - 10th, in Bel Air, Maryland.

## Before the camp

- Download and install Python 3.4. There is a free installer from 
  [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34) that is 
  convenient, especially on Windows.
- Set up an account on [GitHub](http://github.com).
- We'll be using
  [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html),
  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org),
  [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org),
  [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/),
  and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org). 
  You can experiment with these before the camp.
